## Installation

```
go get github.com/vncntx/captainslog/v2
```

## Usage

This library is designed to provide a familiar yet powerful interface for logging. Each logging method accepts a format string and arguments. Structured logging is supported right out of the box. The Logger allows you to turn colors on/off, specify a datetime format, set the logging threshold, and even provide your own function to control how logs are written.

```go
package main

import (
	"vincent.click/pkg/captainslog/v2"
)

var log = captainslog.NewLogger()

func main() {

	log.Trace("this is %s", "captainslog")
	log.Debug("this is %s", "captainslog")
	log.Info("this is %s", "captainslog")
	log.Warn("this is %s", "captainslog")
	log.Error("this is %s", "captainslog")

	log.Fields(

		log.I("captain", "picard"),
		log.I("first officer", "riker"),
		log.I("science officer", "data"),
		log.I("medical officer", "crusher"),
		log.I("chief engineer", "la forge"),
		log.I("security officer", "worf"),

	).Info("starship enterprise")

}
```

## Format

There are several [log formats](./docs/format.md) included that you can choose from. It's also easy to write your own custom function to print logs just the way you want to.

## Performance

The main goals of this library are convenience and familiarity for programmers, but it should have reasonable performance for most projects. To see for yourself, run the benchmarks using `./tools benchmark`.

## Development
